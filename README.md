# complexity

an application to explore the complex plane using [domain colored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) graphs

specifically, the CPM from [NIST](http://dlmf.nist.gov/help/vrml/aboutcolor#S2) is used for consistency

# dependencies

complexity uses Qt for the GUI, and [muparserx](https://github.com/beltoforion/muparserx) for equation parsing and evaluation

other than that, its just c++, and should be fairly portable

# build
qmake
